FIBER WALK DEMO

The Fiber Walk class to run a Fiber Walk simulation.

The demo uses:
- the networkX package (http://networkx.lanl.gov/)
- the numpy package (http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/)
- the scipy package (http://www.scipy.org/SciPy)
- the classes Lattice and FiberWalk written by Alexander Bucksch

Note: The graphics shown in the paper where generated with mayavi2
(http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/index.html)

The code is free for non-commercial use.
Please contact the author for commercial use.

Please cite the Fiber Walk Paper if you use the code for your scientific project.

INSTRUCTIONS

Running the demo:

1.) make sure you have python 2.3, numpy 1.3, scipy 0.9 and networkX 1.7 properly installed
The Demo may run with older versions, but no guarantee 

2.) copy the files Lattice.py, FiberWalk.py and main.py to a folder your choice.

3.) on the command line, go to the folder of your choice

4.) type: python main.py

5.) The program generates saves plots in the creates subfolder FiberWalks and python pickles of the walk data in the folder you have chosen.

6.) Happy Walking!

Changing walk parameters:

1.) open main.py in a text editor

2.) search for the following section

#Fiber Walk parameters    
dimension = 2 # choose dimension
numberOfSteps = 100 # choose the length of the walk
numberOfObjects = 5 # choose number of walks to be generated
numberOfContractions = 1 # choose number of contractions per step

3.) adjust the variables as you wish

4.) save the file and run the demo

5.) Happy Walking!
